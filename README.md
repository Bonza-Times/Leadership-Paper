Leadership-Paper
================

This is how I put together a paper I wrote in grad school. All of the data work is done in R. A change model was used 
for the statistical analysis because I was trying to pick up the difference in campaign contributions from election 
cycle to election cycle.

"pre-workshop" is work done before I presented at our department workshop. "post workshop" is work done after and 
includes my submitted paper. "for fun" is a couple data visualizations I did in R for fun using ggplot2.
